      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        We have developed a mathematical model designed to visualize the brain within a cybernetic or digital framework. The model enables estimation of the total number of neurons, denoted by \( n \), where \( n \) typically lies between \(10^{10}\) and \(10^{11}\). An average human brain neurons (estimate) is then: ~86,000,000,000. For each neuron, we determine its individual mass ("n-mass," expressed in kilograms or in picograms: the minimum weight of a human neuron is about zero point zero six picograms, the average weight is about four picograms, and the maximum weight is about five hundred picograms) as well as its exact spatial coordinates within a Cartesian system \((X, Y, Z)\), centered at the center of mass of the entire neuronal system ("n-brain"). In this system, the \(X\)-axis points forward from the center of mass toward the midline of the human face, the \(Z\)-axis points vertically upward, and the \(Y\)-axis follows the conventional right-handed orientation.

      <h2>Neuron Surface Representation</h2>
      <p>
        The surface of each neuron (the “neuron skin”) is represented using the most regular lattice of equilateral triangles, with side length fixed at \( a = 1\,\text{Å} \). This choice is both aesthetically pleasing and computationally convenient. Each vertex of the triangular lattice on a given neuron is indexed sequentially from 1 to \( m \). These vertices are then projected onto a horizontal plane and plotted on a local Cartesian \((X, Y)\) system centered at the neuron’s own center of mass.
      </p>

      <h2>Vertex Annotation</h2>
      <p>
        Each plotted vertex, denoted as \(\alpha_k\) for \(k = 1,\dots,m\), is assigned a value corresponding to its vertical distance from the neuron’s center of mass. This allows both spatial visualization and mathematical analysis of the neuron surface geometry.
      </p>

      <h2>Scaling from Soma to Full Neuron</h2>
      <p>
        In the present framework, the lattice-based surface discretization was initially applied only to the neuronal soma, treated as an approximately spherical compartment; however, this represents a lower bound on the true complexity of neuronal morphology. A neuron’s membrane surface area is dominated by its dendritic arborizations and axon, which together can increase surface area by one to two orders of magnitude relative to the soma. Using the equilateral-triangle lattice at ångström resolution (vertex density \( \rho \approx 1.1547 \times 10^{8}\, \text{points}/\mu\text{m}^2 \)), a cerebellar granule cell with total membrane area \(200\! -\! 500\,\mu\text{m}^2\) yields roughly \(2.3 \times 10^{10} - 5.8 \times 10^{10}\) vertices, a cortical pyramidal neuron with \(3 \times 10^{4} - 10^{5}\,\mu\text{m}^2\) yields \(3.5 \times 10^{12} - 1.2 \times 10^{13}\) vertices, a spinal motor neuron with \(5 \times 10^{4}\,\mu\text{m}^2\) yields about \(5.8 \times 10^{12}\), and a cerebellar Purkinje neuron with \(2 \times 10^{5}\,\mu\text{m}^2\) yields about \(2.3 \times 10^{13}\). Extrapolating to the whole brain (\(80 - 90\) billion neurons) gives totals ranging from ~\(10^{21}\) vertices for all granule-like neurons to ~\(10^{24}\) vertices for Purkinje-like neurons, illustrating the immense resolution afforded by this representation.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed framework provides a rigorous and visually coherent way to describe neuron geometry within a cybernetic brain model. By combining coordinate conventions, equilateral-triangle lattices, and systematic vertex indexing, the model establishes a foundation for digital visualization and further computational exploration. Moreover, by scaling from soma-only approximations to full-membrane reconstructions, the framework highlights the computational enormity of whole-brain lattice mapping at ångström resolution.
