      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        We have developed a mathematical model designed to visualize the brain within a cybernetic or digital framework. The model enables estimation of the total number of neurons, denoted by \( n \), where \( n \) typically lies between \(10^{10}\) and \(10^{11}\). An average human brain neurons (estimate) is then: ~XX,YYY,000,000. For each neuron, we determine its individual mass ("n-mass," expressed in kilograms or in picograms: the minimum weight of a human neuron is about zero point zero six picograms, the average weight is about four picograms, and the maximum weight is about five hundred picograms.) as well as its exact spatial coordinates within a Cartesian system \((X, Y, Z)\), centered at the center of mass of the entire neuronal system ("n-brain"). In this system, the \(X\)-axis points forward from the center of mass toward the midline of the human face, the \(Z\)-axis points vertically upward, and the \(Y\)-axis follows the conventional right-handed orientation.
      </p>

      <h2>Neuron Surface Representation</h2>
      <p>
        The surface of each neuron (the “neuron skin”) is represented using the most regular lattice of equilateral triangles, with side length fixed at \( a = 440\,\text{Å} = 44\,\text{nm} \). This choice is both aesthetically pleasing and computationally convenient. Each vertex of the triangular lattice on a given neuron is indexed sequentially from 1 to \( m \). These vertices are then projected onto a horizontal plane and plotted on a local Cartesian \((X, Y)\) system centered at the neuron’s own center of mass.
      </p>

      <h2>Vertex Annotation</h2>
      <p>
        Each plotted vertex, denoted as \(\alpha_k\) for \(k = 1,\dots,m\), is assigned a value corresponding to its vertical distance from the neuron’s center of mass. This allows both spatial visualization and mathematical analysis of the neuron surface geometry.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed framework provides a rigorous and visually coherent way to describe neuron geometry within a cybernetic brain model. By combining coordinate conventions, equilateral-triangle lattices, and systematic vertex indexing, the model establishes a foundation for digital visualization and further computational exploration.
