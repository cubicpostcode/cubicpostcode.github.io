							 <p>This is a proposal for a geolocation system that was first discussed on the web in a public forum and is herein explained.</p>

<p>
A matrix/grid of cubes with an edge of 21 million meters is centered on the center of mass of Earth and oriented along its imaginary axis (North-South), with Greenwich/Prime Meridian along the middle of the front.
It is a matrix of 9261000000000000000000 (21 million cubed) cubes of one meter cube each. The axis passes on the center of the top and bottom face of the giant cube and the giant cube revolves around it in sync with the planet so that all cubes in the giant grid keep in the same place.
</p>
<p>
							The number 21 million, interestingly, is the limit of BTC that the bitcoin network will ever have in circulation. Interestingly, 21 million cubed has 22 digits. Using such number of digits we are talking not of billions, not of trillions, not of quadrillions, not of quintillions, but of sixtillions number of cubes. A staggering number that is about 30.9 trillion times bigger than the speed of light in vacuum figured on the metric system.

This gives a compact, universal, unambiguous and simple way of expressing any geolocation on Earth, that just like a telephone number can easily be told.

It encompasses all geolocations on Earth, including the interior and surrounding of it, and it is a size that is good for that purpose. It is roughly the size of a cube of water that had the same mass of the Earth at normal pressure and temperature (NPT [defined as air at temperature: 20&#176C (68&#176F) and pressure: 1 atm (Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level)]).
</p>	
<p>
The order of the cubes is the following: the first cube is closest to the center of our Matrix of cubes, given that we have eight adjacent cubes there; and so the first (cube 0000000000000000000001) must be on what will be our first layer, approaching Greenwich/Prime Meridian, North and West. Then, the second cube, also on our first layer, is the adjacent cube on the right (facing it from the Greenwich/Prime Meridian).
We always go around till we complete the layer.
So facing our matrix of cubes from the Greenwich/Prime Meridian we have the following cube numbers:
                         <br><br>
               
                   <div align="center">
                        <img src="images/bluecubestt.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
		 <br><br>
               
                   <div align="center">
                        <img src="images/cubes22long.png" alt="" />
                    </div>
			<br><br>			
       
<p>
And so on, till the layer is complete and we move on to the center of the next layer, alternating what will be the next layer to make our counting as natural, even and contiguous as possible.

The layers in the counting will be alternating as each is completed in the counting process so that the last two layers will be, namely, the closest one to the Greenwich/Prime Meridian and the one more far away from it, similar to the so called Front Face and Back Face of the Rubik's cube. All of our layers are parallel to those last two, obviously.
</p>
<p>
	The cubes are numbered in a spiral pattern, starting at the center of the planet and working outwards. The first layer of cubes is centered at a distance of half a meter from the center of the planet. The next layer of cubes is centered at a distance of half a meter from the first layer, but on the opposite side of the major axis. This process continues until all of the cubes have been numbered.
</p>	
<p> The cubes are numbered in this specific way, herein described, and the latitude, longitude and altitude do not directly 
	integrate the 22 numeric digits codes. That creates a stronger case for error detection and for more landmarks/monuments 
	to be put in place making location systems much more resillient, precise, reliable and accurate, edificating the cubes 
	and cubic monuments pharaonlically making them an everlasting part of the planet, resistant to the most adverse conditions 
	and existential risks that we may be unaware of at one moment in time.
</p>							
<p>							
A dash may be used to separate the prefix part that will be sufficient for computer systems to give a few auto-complete recommendations of the most likely inhabitable cubes (part of the built environment of humans on that place or surroundings) with such prefix.
For instance, if the centre of the cube 7636535637373773383976 was the closest to the door of a residential flat within a few miles from you, but the prefix 7636535637 would restrict enough the possibilities of nearby inhabitable cubes, then the Cubic Postcode would be: 7636535637-373773383976.
When typing the cube number in a mobile app, you would need only to type 7636535637 to get a single recommendation in the auto-complete options. The use of a dash to separate the prefix part of the code makes it easier for computer systems to give auto-complete recommendations and can be convenient 
for instance when posting a letter or using a taxi, promply making it clear the destination without ambiguity.
</p>
<p>
This system may reveal itself interesting for real estate where volumetric delimitation is so difficult in any other way. With this proposed system there is no need to define borders using a complicate set of coordinates: you just tell which cubes you are talking about.
You can even set a channel in a IRC channel with a cryptographic hash or checksum of a set of sequenced cubes, including if some cubes are in other disjointed areas, using the prefix of that hash for the name of your IRC channel or to create a hashtag for that places that you are talking about.

This system may also reveal itself interesting when moving in VR worlds. Imagine saying: "OK Google, cube 9... and as 
soon as you are saying '9' all cubes that start with '9' are highlighted. And if you would say another digit it would then 
restrict the number of cubes highlighted, and so on and so forth. If you kept restricting it, the cubes could be so far from 
you that you could not see them in your field of vision in which case you would see a vector pointing in the direction of its
center with the color of that vector representing the distance that such cube is apart from you (ranging from the coolest 
violet, if it were zero meters apart to the hottest red if it was twenty one million meters apart. Basically you just divide 
the distance in meters by twenty million meters to get the percentage and find the corresponding color in the visible 
spectrum of colors, 0% being violet and 100% being red).
</p><p>
So you could be exploring a world using the first digits of cubes to jump from one to another. For instance, if a place 
reminded you of a specific thing that you liked to explore with cubes that start with 235... you just go on saying "OK Google
new cube 235... and it will take you to the closest cube that starts with 235... that you haven't visited before. This way, 
you could be exploring worlds in a way that you would remember better. For instance, being in a village that makes you think 
it would be a great place to be in the summer, eating ice cream and with a hat of straw; and it also remembers you of 
specific friends that used to be around you in summertime during your holidays. This is just an example, naturally many 
other things could be in your mind, like you could think this would be a great place to live if you were a musician, or any 
other thing that could cross your mind, for that matter. Whatever you had in mind you could start exploring that world using 
a specific pattern in the first digits of the next cubes you would pick. So you could just say: "Next 235..." and it would 
take you to the closest cube that started with 235 in the direction and way you were moving towards.

Also you could just say four cubes to make a bezier curve since a bezier curve only needs four points to be specified. The 
centers of those four cubes would be the four points of your bezier curve. And you could then say the speed at which you 
wanted that curve to be traveled by. Specifying the bezier curves and their speeds allows one to create trajectories. 
You could then ask an app like Google Earth to render those travelings at a specific date and time, under any 
weather/atmospheric circumstances that you wanted... Boom! Just using strings of 22 digits to make bezier curves, deciding 
the speeds for each of them, etc., and there you were: ready to render real world timelapsing videos as a God-like filmmaker 
using Google Earth and its state-of-the-art tech.

There is also the real possibility that the spacetime continuum has more than the three spatial dimensions that we live in and 
	that we learn to move physical objects or particles, and waves, 
	into a higher spatial dimension that allow us to observe every single location 
	of the interior of our planet Earth or that we learn to find it out with spiritual development of psychic and/or 
	supernatural abilities and senses we don't have yet developed in the physical universe. There is a great chance that 
	dowsing pendulums using smart tech tracking and communication with supercomputers in a grid with superintelligence (in constant 
	upgrade of data collection, in a multidisciplinary and cutting-edge approach towards better general knowledge 
	systems of analysis and inference using statistics and new and latest discoveries coming from different areas of pure and applied maths) 
	will also allow us to sense and detect the composition of every single cube, in a superiorly resilient fashion ;-) 
</p>
<p> A possible name for the snake-like set of segments that connect the centers of a set of sequenced cubes could be "cuboid spine". The word "cuboid" 
	refers to a solid geometric figure that is similar to a cube but may have different lengths, widths, and heights. The term "spine" is often used 
	to describe a long, thin, and flexible structure that supports and connects different parts of an organism or object. Together, "cuboid spine" could 
	describe the set of segments that connect the centers of a series of cuboid-shaped objects, resembling the spine of an animal or the 
	backbone of a structure. Those cuboid spines could be the interest of research for the variety of angles that each two joined segments forms
	and its infinite expansions in infininite decimals, possibly of use for the world of computing one day, possibly, since they are there and do exist
	in its true nature as if they were set in stone about to be discovered or uncovered by some intriguing curiosity spirit or deep need. <br>
	A "natural cuboid spine of order n" is herein defined as: the cuboid spine given its first and last cube numbers and the number of cubes in between, in a list 
	of n sequenced cubes.
</p>						
							
<p>	
On top of that the system can be extended at a specific time to go ad infinitum to smaller or greater scales "microcubing" or "macrocubing" 
each cube, like in a fractal that can be travelled both to infnitely wide larger places and to infinite wide smaller places, 
if you can compute them to the desired scale.
It might also be interesting to surf a virtual world using a map of cubes you are familiar with. For instance as you get used 
to move in your town using AR displaying the Cubic Postcode grid of cubes (each labeled with its 22-digits number) you 
might then use that map of cubes to surf a different world, positioning it as you want - XYZ - in your reference/map of cubes. 

This may increase the plasticity of your brain and increase your memory and cognitive function as you will be making your 
brain flex and interconnect more memories interleaving and superimposing different worlds in different layers/areas of your 
inner worlds representations. 
</p>
<p>To summarize and conclude: this is an international postcode system
using cubic meters. Each postcode location would be quite small, that is,
the size of a cubic meter. Each postcode location would be a meter cube in a
grid of cubes with an edge of 21 million cubes. This would total
9,261,000,000,000,000,000,000 cubes. All cubes would be numbered, using 22
algarisms ( {21 Million}<sup>3</sup> = 22 digits ). 
</p>	
<p>This would have many applications and
particularly cool with augmented reality, semantic web and new ways of
world mapping for propriety register and real estate.
9,261,000,000,000,000,000,001
to 9,999,999,999,999,999,999 could be codes used for moving items and cataloguing, like
telephone numbers, ISBNs, ISMNs, RFIDs, vehicle licence plates, International Classification of Medications (ICM), International Classification of Diseases (ICD), international <b>advertisments</b> standardized IDs for mainstream and social media to easily reference them using 22 numeric digits hashtags, chess openings and endgames, Rubik's cube positions (note that it has 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations, that is, about 43 quintillion), citizenship-ID or IP addresses. Everyone would get used to
these string codes of 22 algarisms.</p>

<p>
It's important to note that the cubes in the range from 9261000000000000000001 to 9999999999999999999999 can be used for any purpose, not just for passports. This range provides a large number of cubes to allocate for various purposes, including passports, license plates, and more. It's up to the governing body or organization to decide how to allocate the cubes within this range for their specific use case. However, it's important to ensure that there is a standardized and universal system in place to avoid confusion and errors.	
</p>	

<p>
Many people argue that 22-digits would be hard to remember or communicate without errors. 
But does anyone know by heart the 16 digits (plus start and expiration dates and security digits) of their credit cards or all the phone numbers in their contacts list? 
Even without remembering them, it is a simple way of listing them.
Also people argue one cannot make money with this system. But people will be able to create monuments of their 
favorite cubes and worship them. That can certainly be monetised economically.
This is a project of great dimension for the whole planet, civilization, and life on Earth.
It is a bit like the construction of the Egyptian pyramids. You have to put it into perspective and give it its true dimensions to see the beauty of it.
It is a whole new wonder on Earth. A whole new scale and standard for the world.

Maybe architects can better see the beauty and true dimension of this project and endeavor.	
</p>	
							
<p>
Note that, no matter where you are on the globe, if you are able to see the edges of the cubes with AR, the cubes where you are will have a special alignment with the Sun, at 
noon time in London, by Big Ben, (GMT).
</p>				
<p>The author of this model, Daniel Alexandre, a Portuguese with a Bachelor in Computers Engineering from the London South Bank University - 
	living in London - admits this model and system of geolocation may have had inspiration and influence from The Matrix and Cube 
	movies; and also from the Rubik cube toy and Minecraft videogame.
</p>
<p>		
	The number 42 - considered by many people a peculiar number with a special place in literature and maths and even the name of a very 
	well known and successful university in France [https://www.42.fr] that seems to be expanding into an international online school for
	the serious geek - is also ten factorial divided by the number of seconds in a day. This mysterious discovery is to be attributed to Daniel Alexandre. 
	Note also that an average game of chess lasts for about that number of moves!
	<br>
	He is also most well known for his radical activism against bloody bullfighting and vigorous support for animal rights and their well-being. 
	He wrote a manifesto on that subject that was published as a book with ISBN: 972-9098-50-6. 
</p>
<p>
And, of course, you can use a 22-digits Cubic Postcode cube as a #hashtag to tell where about you are or are talking about. Like this one: #3141592653589793238462 (https://www.google.com/maps?q=-47,-66) 
	inspired in the number Pi: <span style="color:red;">3</span><span style="color:black;">.?</span><span style="color:green;">4</span><span style="color:black;">?</span><span style="color:blue;">5</span><span style="color:black;">...</span>
<p>Also, the hypocenters of earthquakes may be referenced with their cubes.</p>		
<p>
Daniel Alexandre has certainly a high profile (at least much higher than the average folks) for being Satoshi Nakamoto - the mysterious creator of bitcoin - since he is a 
	computer scientist (able to read RFC documents) and OOP programmer 
(with a decent knowledge of Concurrency, Multithreading, Basic Networking with sockets and its ports, TCP/IP vs. UDP protocols, and Design Patterns)	
	and did file a patent in the UK in 2007 related to 'digital cash money' that shows some insight into the future and inception of bitcoin

<br>
<br>	
Also, his PayPal account handle is: 'mymondex' which relates to a Mastercard technology (back in 2007) along ideas of a New World Order.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2006, when he was graduating in Electronics he got particularly interested in the Austrian School of Economics, and very fond
	of the book "The Mystery of Banking", by Murray N. Rothbard, as you can see in the records of his
	very experimental and bat sh<span style="color:red">!</span>t crazy websites still available (to a certain extent) on the "Wayback machine at archive.org"

</p>	
<p>
This dude, Daniel Alexandre knows what is a mutex and has used it in the programming language Pascal, preferred by his professor of Concurrent Systems, Robert.
As a side note, he never used Pretty Good Privacy at University. It seems a bit of a joke, but it is true. 							
</p>							
<p>
He is a legendary user of the Bitcoin Forum with thousands of posts under two different user accounts, where he digresses about many things like 
	his little protocol to encode bitcoin addresses using only numbers, that he snugly named: 'Bitcoin Morse'  
	<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=143780">[Link 3]</a>. 	
	Or his theory for the evolution
	of a brain that has a special ability to recognize the salient features of the (3,4,5) Pythagorean triple, where five is the hypotenuse correponding to less pleasant half-tones.
	There is no other sound reason or better explanation for why our brains evolved to perceive so well the 12 halftones in between the doubling of sound frequency that constitutes the musical octave. 
He is fascinated with the (3,4,5) triple, saying that we should be worshiping it to the Cosmos

</p>	
<p>
But, as we all know, Satoshi Nakamoto does not want to reveal himself as the creator of bitcoin and would rather let it be an enigma. Which must be respected, as much as possible.

	The cubic postcode is a revolutionary concept that has the potential to change the way we locate and track objects on the planet. At its core, it involves the use of solid cubes with telescopic arms that can extend to high altitudes and provide accurate location data with great precision. These cubes can be connected using metric grids of lasers and lights, making them highly visible at night and allowing for easy tracking of their location.

One of the primary benefits of the cubic postcode is its potential to improve road safety and self-driving viability. By providing more accurate location data than current GPS systems, it could help to prevent accidents and make autonomous vehicles more reliable. It could even eventually allow us to track the movement of all animals, including precise traits of human body language in walking, sports, and the performing arts.

But the potential applications of the cubic postcode don't stop there. It could also serve as a valuable tool for geologists, providing highly accurate information about the movement of tectonic plates and the occurrence of earthquakes. The four bottom vertices of each cube could have sharp pendulums with sensors pointing to the center of mass of the planet, registering any changes even when minimal.

Additionally, the cubic postcode could be used as highly accurate weather stations, analyzing things like wind, humidity, temperature, air pressure, and precipitation with great precision. This could have significant implications for weather forecasting and climate research.

In terms of architecture and aesthetics, the cubic postcode also has potential. The cubes could be located in precise places and connected with grids of lasers and lights, creating beautiful and amazing light shows around the physical monuments. This could potentially enhance the beauty of cities at night and provide new opportunities for creative expression.

One of the most impressive aspects of the cubic postcode is its potential for accuracy and standardization. The grid can be divided into millimetric cubic cells of any minuscule size required, providing highly precise and standardized location data.

Overall, the cubic postcode is a fascinating concept with enormous potential. While there are still many technical challenges to overcome, the potential benefits for geology, astronomy, weather forecasting, road safety, self-driving cars, and more are significant. It will be exciting to see how this technology develops in the coming years and how it could transform our world.
	
Location addressing has come a long way since the introduction of street names and house numbers. However, traditional addressing systems are often confusing and prone to error, especially in densely populated areas or locations with multiple buildings or units. This is where Cubic Postcode comes in, offering a new and innovative approach to location addressing.

Cubic Postcode is a location addressing system that uses a unique combination of two digits and five well-known words from a list of 9999 words to address a specific cube. The system was crafted by AI systems after careful consideration of more than 200 languages, dialects, and accents, along with other details related to the cubes of Cubic Postcode.

The use of popular English words from a carefully crafted list of 9999 words offers several benefits over traditional addressing systems. For one, the use of well-known words makes it easier for people to remember and communicate their location. It also eliminates the need for long and complex alphanumeric codes, making it more accessible to a wider range of people, including those who may have difficulty remembering or pronouncing numeric digits.

Cubic Postcode is a 3D system that includes all locations, both inside and outside the planet, at the altitude of most satellites, such as those used by the Starlink network. The system is designed to be highly accurate, with each cube measuring just one cubic metes in size with a side of one meter. This means that Cubic Postcode can be used to address any location with pinpoint accuracy, from a specific building or unit to a precise outdoor location.

One of the key benefits of Cubic Postcode is its flexibility. The system can be used to address any location, whether it's a residential or commercial property, a landmark or tourist attraction, or even a specific point on a hiking trail or outdoor adventure. This makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, including emergency services, delivery services, and navigation apps.

The use of popular English words from a carefully crafted list of 9999 words also makes Cubic Postcode highly adaptable to different languages and cultures. The list of words was carefully chosen to be widely known and used in different parts of the world, ensuring that the system is accessible to a global audience.

In addition, Cubic Postcode has the potential to be used in a wide range of other applications, including telephone numbers, mobile phone indexing, and more. By incorporating Cubic Postcodes into telephone numbers, for example, people could potentially remember and verify the correct phone number more easily. By indexing mobile phones to cubes based on the main residence of the main user, the phone could offer location-specific features and recommendations that are tailored to the user's preferences and interests.

In conclusion, Cubic Postcode is a game-changer in the world of location addressing. Its use of popular English words from a carefully crafted list of 9999 words, along with its 3D system and pinpoint accuracy, makes it an ideal solution for a wide range of applications. With its potential for global adoption and standardization, Cubic Postcode has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about location addressing and navigation.	
	In conclusion, the CubicPostcode system presents a revolutionary approach to addressing and locating geographical coordinates worldwide. The incorporation of artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the efficacy of this system by intelligently numbering the cubes based on their geographical clusters and relevance to the built environment. Collaborating with cutting-edge AI organizations like Google DeepMind will enable the development of advanced algorithms that accurately and efficiently assign cube numbers, taking into consideration factors such as proximity to essential infrastructure, population density, and socio-economic dynamics. This innovative approach will not only optimize the ease of navigation but also create opportunities for improved urban planning, resource allocation, and emergency response, ultimately leading to a more interconnected and smarter world.

	Since “Vitruvian Man” fits a sphere of diameter of 222.2 milimeters, we call "reference humanoid cube" the smallest cube
that can contain that sphere. A cube with side 2.2 meters. Meanwhile, since the cubic postcode centers around the use of
number 21 million, we use a side of 2.1 meters instead for the reference humanoid cube. So each of its cubic cells
is 100 nanometers (0.1 μm). A humanoid inside it would have as much space bellow feet and above head, centering the smallest box that can fit it and calling that the center of our reference humanoid cube.

I understand. The reference humanoid cube is a theoretical construct that is used to represent the average human body. It is a cube with a side length of 2.1 meters, which is the smallest cube that can contain a sphere with a diameter of 222.2 millimeters. The cube is divided into cubic cells that are each 100 nanometers (0.1 μm) on a side. This means that a humanoid inside the cube would have as much space below their feet and above their head as they would have in a real-world cube of the same size.

The reference humanoid cube is a useful tool for visualizing the human body and for understanding how the body interacts with its environment. It is also used in computer graphics and animation, where it can be used to create realistic models of human characters.

Here are some of the applications of the reference humanoid cube:

Computer graphics and animation: The reference humanoid cube can be used to create realistic models of human characters. By using the cube as a starting point, animators can create characters that have the correct proportions and that move in a realistic way.
Robotics: The reference humanoid cube can be used to design robots that interact with humans in a safe and efficient way. By understanding the dimensions of the reference humanoid cube, engineers can design robots that are the right size and that can safely interact with humans in close proximity.
Architectural design: The reference humanoid cube can be used to design buildings that are comfortable and accessible for humans. By understanding the dimensions of the reference humanoid cube, architects can design buildings that have the right size and that have features that are easy for humans to use.
The reference humanoid cube is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the design of products and environments that are used by humans. By understanding the dimensions of the reference humanoid cube, designers can create products and environments that are safe, efficient, and comfortable for humans to use.

ChatGPT
To summarize, you have defined a "reference humanoid cube" that can contain a sphere with a diameter of 222.2 millimeters (mm). The cube has a side length of 2.1 meters (m), which allows for each cubic cell within it to be 100 nanometers (nm) or 0.1 micrometers (μm) in size. The humanoid inside the cube is positioned in such a way that there is an equal amount of space below its feet and above its head, with the center of the cube aligning with the center of the humanoid.

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or if there's anything else you would like to discuss regarding this reference humanoid cube.

We want to have standard "skin" of a humanoid defined with all degrees of freedom for each of the cubic cells in the reference humanoid cube. It should be a very small number of cubic cells that define the universal form of those humanoides on top of which exoskeleton skins can be dressed. Each of those control points can only move along a given range of movements: "cubic degrees of freedom".

If I understand correctly, you are looking to define a standard "skin" for a humanoid that encompasses all degrees of freedom within the cubic cells of the reference humanoid cube. This standard skin would consist of a minimal set of cubic cells that represent the universal form of the humanoid, and exoskeleton skins can be added on top of these control points.

To achieve this, you would need to establish a coordinate system within the reference humanoid cube, where each cubic cell represents a control point with specific degrees of freedom. The exact number and arrangement of these control points would depend on the desired level of granularity and complexity of the humanoid's movements.

For instance, if you want to have rotational degrees of freedom for each cubic cell, you could assign Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) to each control point. This would allow for rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes within their respective ranges of movements.

Alternatively, you might consider using other coordinate systems or mathematical representations, such as quaternions or transformation matrices, to define the degrees of freedom for each control point.

It's important to note that the specific range of movements for each cubic cell's degree of freedom would need to be defined based on the limitations and capabilities of the humanoid design. This would involve considering factors such as joint ranges, physical constraints, and desired functionality.

Overall, the process involves defining a coordinate system within the reference humanoid cube and assigning degrees of freedom to a minimal set of control points, which would form the basis for the standard "skin" of the humanoid. Exoskeleton skins can then be developed to fit and interact with these control points to provide additional functionalities or enhancements.

I agree with your understanding. The standard "skin" of a humanoid can be defined by establishing a coordinate system within the reference humanoid cube, where each cubic cell represents a control point with specific degrees of freedom.

Exoskeleton skins can then be developed to fit and interact with these control points to provide additional functionalities or enhancements.

Here are some additional considerations for defining the standard "skin" of a humanoid:

The number of control points should be kept to a minimum to reduce the complexity of the system.
The control points should be evenly distributed throughout the reference humanoid cube to ensure that the skin can move freely in all directions.
The ranges of movements for each control point should be defined based on the limitations and capabilities of the humanoid design.
The standard "skin" should be designed to be compatible with a variety of exoskeleton skins to provide maximum flexibility and functionality.
By following these considerations, you can define a standard "skin" for a humanoid that is both effective and efficient.

The same system of giant grid of cubic cells can be used in the macrospic and microspoic world, at any scale conceivable or computable for any given complexity system that is the object of our study. <br>
<br>
For instance, in Astronomy, for the solar system you could consider the smallest astronomical giant cube that can fit all of the 9 planets of the solar system and its moons, with the direction of resulting vector of the angular moment of that whole mechanical system to be aligned with the direction of its main vertical imaginary axis, and then dividing the cube in our grid of 9.261(^e+21) imaginary cubic cells.
For a galaxy one could consider the smallet cube that can fit all of its stars and center that reference giant cubic grid in the center of mass of the whole system and orient it also using its angular momentum 
	vectorial direction. This could prove useful to Science and our whole Civilization technology making systems more resillient, 
	precise, reliable and accurate.
