      Title: The Snooker Cars of the Future Inventors' Prize '24
      <br><br>

Aim: The aim of this competition is to encourage children to think creatively and come up with innovative designs for road vehicles that are spherical and can move smoothly without wheels or tires. The competition also aims to promote the use of renewable energy sources and sustainable materials in the design of these vehicles.
<br><br>
Rules:
<br><br>
1) The competition is open to children aged 10-16 years old. <br>
2) Participants can either enter as individuals or as teams of up to four members. <br>
3) Each participant/team must submit a design for a spherical road vehicle that can move smoothly without wheels or tires. <br>
4) The design must incorporate renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or kinetic energy. <br>
5) The design must also use sustainable materials such as recycled plastics or biodegradable materials. <br>
6) Entries must be submitted in digital format (PDF, JPEG, or PNG) and must include a detailed description of the design, along with sketches or renderings. <br>
7) The competition will be judged by a panel of experts from the automotive and sustainable materials industries. <br>
8) The winning entry will be awarded a cash prize of $10,000, and the top 10 entries will be showcased at the TESLA headquarters. <br>
9) All entries must be submitted by December 31, 2023. <br>
10) The competition organizers reserve the right to disqualify any entry that does not comply with the rules or that contains inappropriate or offensive content.
<br><br>
      By organizing this competition, TESLA can tap into the creativity and ingenuity of the younger generation to help it develop new ideas and solutions for sustainable transportation. It will also help raise awareness among young people about the importance of using renewable energy sources and sustainable materials in the design of vehicles.

      The book "Learn All Differential Equations Topics with Physics and C++" would be a comprehensive guide for students and professionals interested in understanding the fundamentals of differential equations and how they relate to physics and programming using the C++ language.
<br><br>
The book could be divided into 12 chapters covering topics such as:
<br><br>
Introduction to Differential Equations <br>
First Order Differential Equations <br>
Higher Order Differential Equations <br>
Systems of Differential Equations <br>
Partial Differential Equations <br>
Applications of Differential Equations in Physics <br>
Numerical Methods for Differential Equations <br>
Introduction to C++ Programming <br>
Solving Differential Equations using C++ <br>
Implementing Numerical Methods in C++ <br>
Applications of C++ in Physics <br>
Case Studies and Projects <br>
Each chapter would include explanations of the underlying concepts, examples, and exercises to reinforce the learning. The book would also include coding examples and projects, allowing the reader to apply the concepts they have learned to practical problems.
<br><br>
The book could be authored by experienced professors in differential equations, physics, and computer science, with contributions from experts in the respective fields. The publisher could collaborate with institutions such as W3C and ISO to ensure that the book adheres to industry standards and best practices.
