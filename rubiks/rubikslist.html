<br><br>
  <p>
   1) "Edge Flip Fixer" - FU'RU (This sequence can be used to fix white edges that are flipped in the top layer of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a catchy phrase that helps you remember the sequence of moves).
<br>
    2) "Edge Mover" - R’DR (This sequence can be used to move a white edge from the middle layer to the bottom layer. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate and drop the edge" to the bottom layer).
<br>
    3) "Corner Placer" - R'D'RD (This sequence can be used to position white corners correctly. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate and turn the corner around" to the correct position).
<br>
    4) "Edge Swapper Right" - URU’R’U’F’UF (This sequence can be used to position middle layer edges correctly on the right side of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, rotate, and flip the edge" to the correct position).
<br>
    5) "Edge Swapper Left" - U’L’ULUFU’F’ (This sequence can be used to position middle layer edges correctly on the left side of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, flip, and rotate the edge" to the correct position).
<br>   
    6) "Yellow Cross Maker" - FRUR’U’F.
<br> 
    7) "Yellow Cross Maker (Alternate)" - FURU’R’F’ (This sequence can be used to create a yellow cross on the top layer when two yellow edges are up. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "flip, rotate, and flip the edges" to create the cross).
<br> 
    8) "Edge Orienter" - RUR’URU2R’U (This sequence can be used to orient yellow edges correctly. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate, unwind, rotate, and undo" the orientation of the edges).
<br> 
    9) "Corner Rotator" - URU'L'UR'U'L (This sequence can be used to rotate the positions of the corners on the top layer of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, rotate, flip, unwind, rotate, flip" the corners to rotate their positions).
