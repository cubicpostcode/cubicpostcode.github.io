List of the 10 Rubik's Cube Beginner Method Sequences:
    </u>  
<br><br>
  <p>
      01) "Edge Flip Fixer" - <b>FU'RU</b> (This sequence can be used to fix white edges that are flipped in the top layer of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a catchy phrase that helps you remember the sequence of moves).
<br>
    02) "Edge Mover" - <b>R’DR</b> (This sequence can be used to move a white edge from the middle layer to the bottom layer. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate and drop the edge" to the bottom layer).
<br>
    03) "Corner Placer" - <b>R'D'RD</b> (This sequence can be used to position white corners correctly. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate and turn the corner around" to the correct position).
<br>
    04) "Edge Swapper Right" - <b>URU’R’U’F’UF</b> (This sequence can be used to position middle layer edges correctly on the right side of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, rotate, and flip the edge" to the correct position).
<br>
    05) "Edge Swapper Left" - <b>U’L’ULUFU’F’</b> (This sequence can be used to position middle layer edges correctly on the left side of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, flip, and rotate the edge" to the correct position).
<br>   
    06) "Yellow Cross Maker" - <b>FRUR’U’F</b>.
<br> 
    07) "Yellow Cross Maker (Alternate)" - <b>FURU’R’F’</b> (This sequence can be used to create a yellow cross on the top layer when two yellow edges are up. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "flip, rotate, and flip the edges" to create the cross).
<br> 
    08) "Edge Orienter" - <b>RUR’URU2R’U</b> (This sequence can be used to orient yellow edges correctly. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "rotate, unwind, rotate, and undo" the orientation of the edges).
<br> 
    09) "Corner Rotator" - <b>URU'L'UR'U'L</b> (This sequence can be used to rotate the positions of the corners on the top layer of the cube. The mnemonic to be thought of as a reminder to "unwind, rotate, flip, unwind, rotate, flip" the corners to rotate their positions).
<br> 
    10)* "Corner Placer" - <b>R'D'RD</b> 
      <br><br> 
      <u>
Tip: Start by being commiting these sequences to memory and being able to perform (with the agility of a great magician) any of these sequences (with eyes closed and without any verbalization or internal dialogue) generating a random integer in the range 1-10: random.org.
