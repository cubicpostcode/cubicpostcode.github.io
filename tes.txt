To whom it may concern,

I am writing on behalf of families and schools across England and the UK to address a growing concern regarding the exposure to inappropriate and harmful content on the internet. As responsible members of the community, it is our duty to ensure that our children and students are protected from such content, and we urge immediate action on several fronts.

Firstly, we request the restriction of access to certain platforms, namely Twitch, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Pornhub, and OnlyFans. While some of these platforms may serve legitimate purposes for communication and entertainment, they also harbor content that is not suitable for young audiences. We strongly urge internet service providers and relevant authorities to implement measures that bar access to these platforms for minors.

Secondly, we call on all stakeholders to engage in a continuous effort to petition Google and other search engines to remove highly classified and inappropriate material from search results. This includes content featuring nudity, pornography, and grotesque imagery. By consistently writing letters and maintaining pressure on these companies, we can work towards a safer online environment.

Moreover, we demand the development and implementation of advanced control software that can detect and filter out sounds of gunfire and sexual or pornographic sounds within living environments. This technology is essential to ensure that even accidental exposure to such content can be minimized or prevented altogether.

We trust that with collective effort and determination, we can create a safer digital space for our children and students. We look forward to seeing positive changes and are willing to support any initiatives that aim to achieve these goals.

Thank you for your attention to this crucial matter.

Yours sincerely,
