  These images shall give you an idea of what is required. The first is probably the best to focus on.
  But I also like the second one, in that it emphasises and exagerates the closeness of the Sun to the Winter solstice,
making that very obvious... The 3rd one goes into more details and accuracy, so can also be used to inspire you into
detail and accuracy. The 4th also emphasises and exagerates the closeness of the Sun to the Winter solstice, which I want
indeed to make obvious. The fifth is quite good in showing the angle of tilt and the direction of rotation, but would be
better if it looked more like the last one. Still I think you should focus on the first one. But have a look at them all
and hope this helps. Any questions?

The imaginary axis out of the North Pole always aims toward Polaris (the brightest star in Ursa Minor, also called the North Star). 
The direction of the axis does not change much as the Earth revolves around the Sun.
Seasons arise because the Earth’s axis is not perpendicular to the plane containing the Earth’s orbit.
The axis makes an angle of 66.5° with that plane, or 23.5° to the perpendicular to it. Any questions?
