Explain me what was the idea behind : placeavote

I'm sorry, but I don't have information about a specific company or platform called "placeavote." It is possible that you are referring to a platform or service that allows users to cast votes or make decisions through an online platform, but without more context it is difficult for me to provide any further information.

placeavote.com

I'm sorry, but I am unable to browse the internet and do not have information about specific websites or platforms. Without more information about the purpose or function of placeavote.com, it is not possible for me to provide any further information about the idea behind it. It is possible that placeavote.com is a platform or service that allows users to cast votes or make decisions through an online platform, but without more context it is difficult to say for certain.

What is the more prospective liquid democracy platform ?

Liquid democracy is a form of governance in which individuals can delegate their voting power to a trusted representative, or "proxy," who can make decisions on their behalf. This allows individuals to have a say in the decision-making process even if they are unable to participate directly, and can help to ensure that the collective will of the group is accurately represented.

There are a number of different platforms that have been developed to facilitate liquid democracy. It is difficult to determine which platform is the most prospective, as different platforms may be more suitable for different contexts and purposes. Some examples of platforms that have been used for liquid democracy include:

    LiquidFeedback: an open-source platform developed by the Pirate Party of Germany that allows users to propose and vote on policy decisions.

    DemocracyOS: an open-source platform that allows users to participate in decision-making processes through online voting and discussion.

    Loomio: a collaboration platform that allows groups to make decisions through online voting and discussion.

Ultimately, the best platform for a particular context will depend on the specific needs and goals of the group or organization using it. It may be helpful to consider factors such as the platform's ease of use, security and privacy features, and integration with other tools or systems when evaluating different liquid democracy platforms.

What about a platform where the laws of all jurisdictions were all in the same place, a bit like a Wikipedia, that made it easy to compare laws in different nations in very simple statements, like "Gay marriage is legal for more than 33 years old" and so on.

It is possible that a platform like the one you describe could be useful for comparing laws in different jurisdictions and understanding the legal landscape in different countries. Such a platform could potentially make it easier for individuals and organizations to understand and comply with the laws in different countries, and could be particularly useful for businesses or organizations that operate in multiple jurisdictions.

There are a number of organizations that maintain databases of laws and legal information for different countries, although these may not be organized in the same way as a Wikipedia-style platform. Some examples include:

    Lexadin: a website that provides access to legal information for over 200 countries, including information on business laws, criminal laws, and tax laws.

    The World Law Guide: a website that provides information on the laws of over 190 countries, including information on civil and criminal law, as well as business laws.

    The Global Legal Information Network (GLIN): a database maintained by the Law Library of Congress that provides access to the laws and legal information of over 190 countries.

These types of resources can be useful for gaining an overview of the laws in different countries, although they may not provide the level of detail or simplicity of presentation that you are describing. It is worth noting that laws can change frequently, so it is important to ensure that the information you are using is up to date.
